Process of testifying student knowledge can be divided into four parts:

1. Creation of Questions
2. Verification of Questions
3. Answering Questions
4. Checking of Questions

First of all, we need to define what exactly questions are questions.
`Question` is a multiple choice question, created by a teacher, lecture, professional or just Knowledgeable person. Creator of `Question` knows the answer to the question in advance. Creator also develops wrong answers to multiple choice questions. Collection of statement of question, correct answer and wrong answers is called `Question`.

### 1. Creation of Questions

In ideal system, everybody can create questions. It would be done through a website or a mobile application. `Question` would be uploaded on Blockchain and would wait for verification. It would be in interest of Question creator:

1. that `Question` be not too easy to answer.
2. that `Question` be properly stated and understandable.  
3. that `Question` be distinct from already existing `Questions`.
4. that `Question` be tagged correctly.
5. and most importantly that `Question's` answer set as correct by question creator, truly be correct.  

If `Question` doesn't satisfy  2, 3 and 5, it would be accepted in verification process and wouldn't be implemented into Blockchain.

**Far Vision** - There would be Question creator studio software, which would be able to create `Question` templates and upload it on Blockchain. `Question` templates would contain variable parts of `Question` and would be able to be customized automatically based on Student. For example - `Question` template could contain `Question` statement: 
> A train leaves {Cairo, Madrid} at {leaving_time}, averaging {first_train_speed} mph.
Another train headed in the same direction leaves {Cairo, Madrid} at {second_train_leaving_time} am, averaging {second_train_speed} mph.
How many hours after the second train leaves will it overtake the first train?

variables `Cairo`, `Madrid`, `leaving_time`, `first_train_speed`, `second_train_leaving_time`, `second_train_speed` will be randomly generated based on question creator rules by the time student must see the question. So, that student sees:

>A train leaves Cairo at 3:00 am, averaging 30 mph.
Another train headed in the same direction leaves Cairo at 6:00 am, averaging 60 mph.
How many hours after the second train leaves will it overtake the first train?

Rules, that if `Cairo` was chosen in first place, second also must be `Cairo` and that `second_train_speed` must be greater than `first_train_speed`, should be provided by question creator.
With Question creator studio software, Question creators can automate the process of creating `Questions`.

**A more distant Vision** - Questions would be created by AI, which would be able to create questions based on Scientific Papers.
