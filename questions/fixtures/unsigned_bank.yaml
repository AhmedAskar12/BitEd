      \ woman comes to the office for follow-up of chronic tension-type headaches.\_\
      \ Her headaches have not improved after several trials of medications, including\
      \ those recommended by a neurologist specializing in the management of headaches.\_\
      \ The patient says, \"I'm really not surprised that this last medication didn't\
      \ work either.\_ All these drug companies just want to make money.\_ I doubt\
      \ that anything will help.\"\_ When asked if she would consider pursuing biofeedback,\
      \ relaxation training, or stress management therapy, she responds, \"There's\
      \ no point\u2014how can I relax or do therapy when my head is pounding?\"\_\
      \ The patient's other medical problems include hypertension and hypercholesterolemia,\
      \ which are well controlled with medication.\_ She has a history of depression\
      \ following her divorce in her 40s but was unwilling to take an antidepressant\
      \ or see a counselor at that time.\_ Which of the following statements is the\
      \ most appropriate response to this patient's concerns?</p></div>"

      \ symptomatic despite the best efforts of the physician to treat her with multiple\
      \ medication trials, and she rejects all recommended nonpharmacological approaches.\_\
      \ Such patients believe that no treatment will help and appear not to want to\
      \ improve.\_ They are often frustrating to manage and can leave the physician\
      \ feeling angry and manipulated.\_ The understandable tendency to want to refer\
      \ this patient to another provider or specialist should be avoided <strong>(Choice\
      \ E)</strong>.</p><p>These patients often have underlying depression but will\
      \ refuse referral to a psychiatrist.\_ They are needy for attention and unconsciously\
      \ wish to remain symptomatic so that they can continue to see a physician.\_\
      \ The best approach is to <strong>empathize</strong> with them and <strong>attempt\
      \ to engage</strong> them in a <strong>collaborative plan</strong> in which\
      \ there is mutual agreement about realistic treatment approaches and <strong>limited\
      \ expectations</strong>.\_ Empathizing with the patient's frustration over disappointing\
      \ outcomes and focusing on alleviation of symptoms rather than a cure is often\
      \ helpful.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and C)</strong>\_ There is insufficient\
      \ information on this patient to diagnose depression, and she would likely reject\
      \ this explanation of her poor response.\_ She has previously rejected counseling\
      \ and is currently resistant to other treatment approaches; therefore, she is\
      \ unlikely to agree to counseling at this stage.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>\_\
      \ This statement attempts to confront this patient by pointing out her help-rejecting\
      \ pattern of behavior.\_ This would likely be perceived as judgmental, resulting\
      \ in loss of rapport and defensiveness.\_ However, it could be useful as part\
      \ of a therapeutic intervention by a skilled therapist in the context of structured\
      \ psychotherapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>\_ The physician has already\
      \ encouraged the patient to consider nonpharmacological approaches.\_ Rather\
      \ than continuing to make treatment recommendations that will likely be rejected,\
      \ the physician should develop a collaborative focus on a small goal that she\
      \ identifies.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br/>Help-rejecting\
      \ patients who are hopeless about treatment can lead the physician to become\
      \ frustrated and confrontational and to desire to refer the patient to another\
      \ provider.\_ Clear expression of empathy and a collaborative approach with\
      \ limited goals are the most effective approaches.</p></div></div></div><div\
